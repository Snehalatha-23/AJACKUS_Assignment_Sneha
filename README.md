## 🖥️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Snehalatha-23/AJACKUS_Assignment_Sneha.git
cd AJACKUS_Assignment_Sneha

Open with VS Code

Right-click index.ftlh → Open with Live Server (or) open manually in browser.

Note: Freemarker templates are simulated. No backend required.

💡 Challenges Faced
Simulating Freemarker logic without server-side rendering

Managing multiple dynamic DOM states (Add/Edit/Delete/Search)

Maintaining responsiveness across devices

Balancing simplicity and functionality within 2-day deadline

🚀 Future Improvements
Integrate real backend with Freemarker engine (Java Spring)

Store data in localStorage or IndexedDB

Add animations for smoother UX

Enhance filters with multi-select and dropdown UI

Implement full Freemarker template engine using Java

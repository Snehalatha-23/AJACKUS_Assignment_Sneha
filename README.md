⚠️ Note
Freemarker templates are simulated.

💡 Challenges Faced
Simulating Freemarker logic without server-side rendering.

Managing multiple dynamic DOM states (Add / Edit / Delete / Search).

Maintaining responsiveness across various device types.

Balancing simplicity vs. functionality within a tight 2-day deadline.

🚀 Future Improvements
Integrate real backend using Freemarker engine (e.g., Java Spring).

Persist data using localStorage or IndexedDB.

Add animations for smoother UX and feedback.

Enhance filters with multi-select and custom dropdown UI.

Implement full Freemarker template engine using Java.
